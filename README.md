# open-uap

This project began as part of the [SF UAP Hackathon](https://www.sf-uap.com/). I
was one of 200 participants invited to take part in this first of its kind
Hackathon in April 2025. I decided to "bring my own UAP mission" and
subsequently open-uap was born.

My initial vision for open-uap is to be an open-source / open-data UAP reporting
platform. Similar to MUFON, but with the very specific purpose of open-sourcing
the data rather than having a single entity maintain legal ownership.

:warning: Documentation may be a bit sparse due to the nature of Hackathons.
